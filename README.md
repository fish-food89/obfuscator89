## Sources

### Names used in Finland (FI)

The primary, but not only source of data for Finnish names, both given and
surnames, has been the open data called "Väestötietojärjestelmän suomalaisten
nimiaineistot" provided and maintained by Digi- ja väestötietovirasto (DVV).
This data was licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and retrieved on
2026-02-08 from https://avoindata.suomi.fi/data/fi/dataset/none. The data was
not used as is, but curated based on the data available from that data set.
