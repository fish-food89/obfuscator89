# Obfuscator89

A standalone data obfuscator tool.

## Languages and locales

Different data sets support different languages and locales. Languages and
locales are kept separate when storing the data as the relationship between
languages and locales is not one to one, but one to many.

### Languages

Languages in the `src/data/` directory hierarchy are expressed in ISO 639-
format.

## Sources

### Finnish (fin) Names

The primary, but not only source of data for Finnish names, both given and
surnames, has been the open data called "Väestötietojärjestelmän suomalaisten
nimiaineistot" provided and maintained by Digi- ja väestötietovirasto (DVV).
This data was licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and retrieved on
2026-02-08 from https://avoindata.suomi.fi/data/fi/dataset/none. The data was
not used as is, but curated based on the data available from that data set.
