# Obfuscator89

A standalone data obfuscator tool.

## Languages and locales

Different data sets support different languages and locales. Languages and
locales are kept separate when storing the data as the relationship between
languages and locales is not one to one, but one to many.

### Languages

Languages in the `src/data/` directory hierarchy are expressed in ISO 639-
format.
